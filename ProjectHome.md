Yalog is a logging tool that comprises a set of classes for inclusion in an Actionscript application, and a viewing application for viewing the generated log messages.

Both parts are kept very lightweight and fast, and hardly cost any processor time or memory space.
A feature that sets it apart from comparable applications is that a set number of messages are kept buffered until a viewing application is present, so the viewer can be started after the fact.

Yala uses LocalConnection as communication means, so can be used for both online and offline Actionscript applications built in Flash, Flex & AIR.

This version of Yala is written in Actionscript 3.
